# YOLO_ITMS
➡️The main objective of Intelligent Traffic Management system is founded
to fix the problem of traffic which most of the cities in urban as well as rural areas
are facing with the help of this project wherein the focus would be to minimize
the vehicular congestion. 
➡️The setup requires traffic data as input which will then
be used with our machine learning model for efficient traffic flow without
creating much chaos on the road. 
➡️The model may take comparatively more
training time but the response time will be less.
➡️The model is prepared in such away that it decides smart switching timing for the signal on all sides of the road
so the no one has to wait for longer interval of time on the road

Note: YOLO Weights need to be added before running.Code is compatible across all Operaging Systems.
Prepared as part of B.Tech final year project Part 1.
The pretrained YOLO model was used.
